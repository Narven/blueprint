# blueprint

> Blueprint is a command line tool to help you scaffold any files/folders structure based on blueprints written in yaml.

## Download

Just download one of the existing [releases](https://github.com/Narven/blueprint/releases) into you path.

# Usage

Create a minimal yaml file called `simple.yml` and paste the following snippet.

```yml
version: 1

name: Simple Blueprint

path: dist/simple

structure:
    - FolderFoo
    - FolderBar
    - README.md: |
        # My Project generated by Blueprint v1
    - .gitignore: |
        .DS_STORE
        yarn.log
        package-lock.json
    - Makefile:
    - .editorconfig:
```

run command:
```bash
blueprint generate -t simple.yml
```

This will generate a folder/file structure based on what was defined in the yml, inside `dist` folder.
Something like this:

```bash
├── FolderBar
├── FolderFoo
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```

### Another example

```yml
version: 1

name: Test1

path: apps/api/internal/calendar

structure:
    - delivery
    - dtos
    - repository
    - usecase
    - delivery.go: |
        package calendar

        type Handlers interface {

        }
    - repository.go: |
        package calendar

        type Repository interface {

        }
    - usecase.go: |
        package calendar

        type UseCase interface {

        }
```

## Releases

`make version=<version> release`

## TODO

[x] Generate basic folder/file structure (1 level deep)
[ ] Generate multi level folder/file structure
[ ] Pass path name using args to replace the one from yml
[ ] Use flags + template system to be to pass variables into the yml file, to make it more dynamic
[ ] Create tests and add them to CI
[ ] Better validation and error reporting
[ ] Add --dry-run
[ ] Be able to import external template files for the files contents
