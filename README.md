# blueprint

> Blueprint is a command line tool to help you scaffold any files/folders structure based on blueprints written in yaml.

## Download

Just download one of the existing [releases](https://github.com/Narven/blueprint/releases) into you path.

# Usage

Create a minimal yaml file called `simple.yml` and paste the following snippet.

```yml
version: 1

name: Simple Blueprint

path: dist/simple

structure:
    - FolderFoo
    - FolderBar
    - README.md: |
        # My Project generated by Blueprint v1
    - .gitignore: |
        .DS_STORE
        yarn.log
        package-lock.json
    - Makefile:
    - .editorconfig:

```

Basic
```bash
blueprint generate -t simple.yml
```

This will generate a folder/file structure based on what was defined in the yml, inside `dist` folder.
Something like this:

```bash
├── FolderBar
├── FolderFoo
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── Makefile
└── README.md
```
